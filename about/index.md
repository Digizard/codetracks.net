So what's this all about here?


### About Me ###

My name is Stacy. :smile: I am the founder of my local CoderDojo and a code
reviewer at Udacity. I'm currently a student in the	Front-End Nanodegree (FEND)
program.


### About This Site ###

During my time as a student in the Front-End Nanodegree program, I've  tried to
make myself notes to keep track of things as I went on. I also helped others in
my group wherever I could.

I decided to sit down and combine these efforts into this little site. Maybe I
could explain things from a point of view that others taking the same courses
could understand. I had gone through it all, too.


### About the Design ###

Currently, this is built with Jekyll and Bootstrap. Trying to get a site
together quickly, I used my Project 1 from the FEND program. I also thought it
would be a little funny to spoof the first project like that.

### About the Name ###

I was playing with Code + Word ideas, and this was one of them. When I threw
together the logo really quick and put it into layout at the time, I knew it was
just right.

Even a Sitting Fox leaves tracks. :laughing:
