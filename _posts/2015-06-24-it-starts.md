Alright, here we are! A bit of a quick setup here, but something is up and
running. There's more that I'd like to do, with things rough as it is, but it
doesn't look too bad. I've never used Jekyll before, but I'm learning and having
a fun time doing so.

That's basically what this little site is about. I've learned a lot as part of
Udacity's Front-End Nanodegree program. Although I've tried making my own little
set of notes, sometimes it's easier to just start talking about something.

I also like to help people. There were times where what information I could find
on a topic or situation was minimal at best, or even just covered in some sort
of word-choice barrier that made it difficult to understand. If I can explain
things better for somebody out there, then awesome. :smile:

This site is pretty barebones at the moment, being a fork of the my Project 1.
For my project, I had mimicked the mock-up pretty closely, and thought I didn't
keep everything, you can still see the resemblance.

This was in part to start with a simple design, using something I had already
made, but I also thought it was a little silly thing to do. I'm not sure if it's
something I'd keep forever, but I've got something for now, and that's all I'm
going to worry about at the moment.
